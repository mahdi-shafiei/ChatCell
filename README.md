<h2 id="3">üõ†Ô∏è Usage</h2>

<h3 id="1">üìö Step1: Prepare the data</h3>

‚ùóÔ∏èNote: You can download the original data from the `raw_data` directory. Alternatively, you can directly download the [pre-processed data we provide on huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zjunlp/ChatCell-Instructions) to **skip Step 1 of the process**.

Change to the evaluation directory with the command: `cd workflow_data`.

**1. For tasks such as random cell sentence generation, pseudo-cell generation, and cell type annotation, we utilize cells from the SHARE-seq mouse skin dataset.**

- Follow these steps to use the  `transform.py` script (This file was initially developed by the [Cell2Sentence](https://github.com/vandijklab/cell2sentence-ft) team, thanks for their great work!ü§ó) to **translate scENA-seq data into cell sentence**:

  - Define `data_filepath` to specify the path to your downloaded SHARE-seq mouse skin dataset `.h5ad` file.
  - Define `output_dir` to specify the directory where the generated cell sentences will be saved.
  - Define `eval_output_dir` to specify where figures and evaluation metrics will be stored.
  - Run the transformation process by executing the following command in your terminal: `python transform.py`.

- Then **covert cell sentences to instructions** with `mouse_to_json.py`:

  - Set `input_path` to the `output_dir` specified in  `transform.py`.
  - Define `train_json_file_path`, `val_json_file_path`, and `test_json_file_path` to specify the paths where you want to save your train, validation, and test datasets in JSON format, respectively.
  - Run the following command in your terminal to start the conversion process: `python mouse_to_json.py`.


**2. For the drug sensitivity prediction task, we select GSE149383 and GSE117872 datasets.**

- For GSE149383: Open `GSE149383_to_json.py`, define `expression_data_path` and `cell_info_path` to the location of your downloaded `erl_total_data_2K.csv` and `erl_total_2K_meta.csv` file.
- For GSE117872: Open `GSE117872_to_json.py`, define `expression_data_path` and `cell_info_path` to the location of your downloaded `GSE117872_good_Data_TPM.txt` and `GSE117872_good_Data_cellinfo.txt` file.
- Update `output_json_path` with the desired location for the JSON output files.
- Execute the conversion script:
  - Run `python GSE149383_to_json.py` for the GSE149383 dataset.
  - Run `python GSE117872_to_json.py` for the GSE117872 dataset.
- Open `split.py`, define `input_path` to the same locations as `output_json_path` used above. Specify the locations for `train_json_file_path`, `val_json_file_path`, and `test_json_file_path` where you want the split datasets to be saved.
- Run the script with `python split.py` to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

**3. After preparing instructions for each specific task, follow the steps below to merge the datasets using the `merge.py` script.**

- Ensure that the paths for `train_json_file_path`, `val_json_file_path`, and `test_json_file_path` are correctly set to point to the JSON files you previously generated for each dataset, such as `GSE117872`, `GSE149383`, and `mouse`.
- Run `python merge.py` to start the merging process. This will combine the specified training, validation, and testing datasets into a unified format, ready for further analysis or model training.


<h3 id="7"> üìú Step2 : Vocabulary Adaptation</h3>

To adapt the tokenizer vocabulary with new terms from cell biology, follow these steps using the `vocabulary_adaptation.py` script.

- Ensure you have the following parameters configured in the script before running it:

  - `tokenizer_last`: The path to the directory containing the pre-existing tokenizer.

  - `tokenizer_now`: The destination path where the updated tokenizer will be saved.

  - `GSE117872_json_file_path`: This should be set to the `output_json_path` variable from the `GSE117872_to_json.py` script

  - `GSE149383_json_file_path`: Similarly, this should match the `output_json_path` variable in the `GSE149383_to_json.py` script.

  - `cell_sentences_hf_path`: This path should correspond to the `cell_sentences_hf` directory, which is specified as the `output_dir` variable within the `transform.py` script

- Once all parameters are configured, execute the script to update the tokenizer's vocabulary with new cell biology terms. Run the following command in your terminal: `python vocabulary_adaptation.py`.

<h3 id="2">üõ†Ô∏è Step3: Train and generate</h3>

**1. Training**

- Open the `finetune.py` script. Update the script with the paths for your training and validation JSON files (`train_json_path` and `valid_json_path`), the tokenizer location (`tokenizer_path`), the base model directory (`model_path`), and the directory where you want to save the fine-tuned model (`output_dir`).
- Execute the fine-tuning process by running the following command in your terminal: `python finetune.py`

**2. Generation**

- Single-Instance Inference:
  - To run inference on a single instance, set the necessary parameters in `inference_one.py`.
  - Execute the script with: `python inference_one.py`.
- Web Interface Inference:  
  - For interactive web interface inference using Gradio, configure `inference_web.py` with the required parameters.
  - Launch the web demo by running: `python inference_web.py`.
- Batch Inference:  
  - For inference on a batch of instances, adjust the parameters in `inference_batch.py` as needed.
  - Start the batch inference process with: `python inference_batch.py`.


<h3 id="3">‚å®Ô∏è Step4: Translating sentences into gene expressions</h3>

**For the pseudo-cell generation task, we also translate sentences into gene expressions, including data extraction and transformation stages.**

- Data Extraction:
  - Open `extract_gene_generation.py`. Set up the necessary parameters for generating cells based on cell type. This step is intended for training datasets larger than 500 samples, covering 16 cell types.
  - Run the following command in your terminal to start the data extraction process: `python extract_gene_generation.py`.

- Transformation Process:
  - After generating the necessary files, proceed by configuring `sentence_to_expression.py` with the appropriate parameters for the translation process.
  - Execute the transformation script with the command: `python sentence_to_expression.py`.
 

<h2 id="4">üöÄ Evaluation</h2>

To evaluate the performance of various tasks, follow these steps:

- Change to the evaluation directory with the command: `cd evaluation`.

- Random Cell Generation Task:
  - Open `Performance_of_random_cell_generation.py`.
  - Specify the `json_path` to the JSON file with the generated data.
  - Specify the `global_path` to the global gene vocabulary file, usually located in the `cell_sentences` subdirectory within `output_dir` specified by the `transform.py` script, and is named `vocab_human.txt`.
  - Run the command: `python Performance_of_random_cell_generation.py`. 

- Pseudo-cell Generation Task:
  - Depending on the format of your data, open `python Performance_of_pseudo-cell_generation_lev.py`, or `python Performance_of_pseudo-cell_generation_expr.py`.
  - Specify the `my_data_path` to the file with the generated pseudo-cell data.
  - Specify the `ground_truth_data_path` to the file with the ground truth data.
  - Specify the `k` to the K-value for KNN analysis.
  - Depending on the format of your data, run: `python Performance_of_pseudo-cell_generation_lev.py`, or `python Performance_of_pseudo-cell_generation_expr.py`.

- Cell Type Annotation and Drug Sensitivity Prediction Tasks:
  - Open `python performance_of_classification.py`.
  - Specify the `my_data_path` to the JSON file containing the generated data for the task.
  - Run the command: `python performance_of_classification.py`.
